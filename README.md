# SvelteKit Remote Debug

This component allows you to debug your [remote functions](https://svelte.dev/docs/kit/remote-functions#form) in the style of the `sveltekit-superforms` library [SuperDebug](https://www.npmjs.com/package/sveltekit-remote-debug).

With the remote functions from SvelteKit, the superforms library isn't always necessary - but still needs a visual debugger when developing.

## How to use

Install the package

```sh
npm i -D sveltekit-remote-debug
```

Then you simply import the debugger in your project together with your remote function

```ts
import { RemoteDebug } from 'sveltekit-remote-debug';
import { myRemoteFormFunction } from '$lib/remote-functions/my-remote-form-function.ts';
```

The `RemoteDebug` takes the `form` as a property to collect it's data.

> Be sure to also add `oninput` to your form, to debug in real time!

```html
<RemoteDebug form="{myRemoteFormFunction}" />

<form {...myRemoteFormFunction} oninput={() => myRemoteFormFunction.validate()}>
	...
</form>
```

Having this in your code, will show a box with your fields and it's values, such as

```json
{
	"firstname": "foo",
	"lastname": "bar"
}
```

### Options

```ts
showIssues?: boolean;
windowed?: boolean;
theme?: BundledTheme;
space?: number;
```

#### showIssues

Enabling this property will also show you a list of all the issues that is generated from your validation schema. This also separates the input data in it's own `data` property.

```json
{
	"data": {
		"firstname": undefined,
		"lastname": "bar"
	},
	"issues": {
		"firstname": ["Firstname is required"],
		"lastname": undefined
	}
}
```

#### windowed

Enabling this property will instead make the debugger an absolute div which you can move around. Here you can also minimize it and copy the content (json) from the box.

#### theme

Because of the simplicity with [shiki](https://github.com/shikijs/shiki?tab=readme-ov-file) that this debugger is using for highlighting, you can also change the theme of your output.

#### space

This option takes a number that defines the tab-spacing for each row of your output.
